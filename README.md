## History

Biblioteca originally started as a built-in offline documentation viewer for [Workbench](https://github.com/sonnyp/Workbench). It was built by Akshay Warrier as a "stretch-goal" of [his 2023 GSoC internship](https://akshaywarrier.medium.com/) under the mentorship of Andy Holmes and Sonny Piers.

The offline docunmetation viewer has been extracted into a standalone repository/app and became Biblioteca.

Akshay and Sonny keep maintaining this project.
